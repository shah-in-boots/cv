  abstract = {Background Autonomic function can be measured noninvasively using heart rate variability (HRV), which indexes overall sympathovagal balance. Deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate is a more specific metric of vagal modulation. Higher values of these measures have been associated with reduced mortality risk primarily in patients with cardiovascular disease, but their significance in community samples is less clear. Methods and Results This prospective twin study followed 501 members from the VET (Vietnam Era Twin) registry. At baseline, frequency domain HRV and DC were measured from 24‐hour Holter ECGs. During an average 12‐year follow‐up, all‐cause death was assessed via the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox frailty models with random effect for twin pair were used to examine the hazard ratios of death per 1‐SD increase in log‐transformed autonomic metrics. Both in the overall sample and comparing twins within pairs, higher values of low‐frequency HRV and DC were significantly associated with lower hazards of all‐cause death. In within‐pair analysis, after adjusting for baseline factors, there was a 22\% and 27\% lower hazard of death per 1‐SD increment in low‐frequency HRV and DC, respectively. Higher low‐frequency HRV and DC, measured during both daytime and nighttime, were associated with decreased hazard of death, but daytime measures showed numerically stronger associations. Results did not substantially vary by zygosity. Conclusions Autonomic inflexibility, and especially vagal withdrawal, are important mechanistic pathways of general mortality risk, independent of familial and genetic factors.},

  abstract = {The clinical significance of hemodynamic reactivity to mental stress in the population with coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear.To investigate the association between hemodynamic reactivity to mental stress and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable CAD.This cohort study included individuals with stable CAD from 2 prospective studies from a university-based hospital network: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 and followed up for a median of 6.0 (IQR, 5.6-6.0) years in MIPS and 4.6 (IQR, 3.8-5.3) years in MIMS2. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2022, to February 15, 2023.The rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated as the mean systolic blood pressure times the mean heart rate at rest. Rate-pressure product reactivity was calculated as the maximum RPP during a standardized mental stress test minus the RPP at rest.The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure.From the total of 938 individuals from the pooled cohort (mean [SD] age, 60.2 [10.1] years; 611 [65.1\%] men), 631 participated in MIPS and 307 in MIMS2. A total of 373 individuals (39.8\%) were Black, 519 (55.3\%) were White, and 46 (4.9\%) were of unknown race or ethnicity. The RPP increased by a mean (SD) of 77.1\%\,(23.1\%) during mental stress (mean [SD] absolute change, 5651\,[2878]). For every SD decrease in RPP reactivity with mental stress, the adjusted hazard ratios for the primary and secondary end points were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.72) and 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.56), respectively, in MIPS and 1.41 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.97) and 1.21 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.60), respectively, in MIMS2. In the pooled sample, when RPP reactivity to mental stress was added to a model including traditional clinical risk characteristics, model discrimination for adverse events improved (increase in C statistic of 5\% for the primary end point; P\,=\,.009).In this cohort study of individuals with stable CAD, a blunted cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress was associated with adverse outcomes. Future studies are needed to assess the clinical utility of mental stress reactivity testing in this population.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in newborns. NEC’s relationship with poor neurocognitive outcomes is established; however additional longitudinal outcomes remain limited, especially for non-surgical NEC. This study explores the association of NEC with longitudinal gastrointestinal morbidity and growth outcomes. Methods: Retrospective matched cohort study of newborns admitted to a level 3 NICU (2008-2011) was performed. Babies diagnosed with NEC and controls matched on birthweight and gestational age were included. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed. Primary outcomes included long-term gastrointestinal diagnoses (GI-Dx; ie: abdominal pain, intestinal gas, jaundice, feeding intolerance, constipation, hernias, ostomy care) recorded at subsequent encounters following NICU discharge. Logistic regression models were developed to examine which demographic and clinical variables were associated with these outcomes. Results: 260 neonates were included: 130 with NEC, 130 controls. Of the NEC cases, 81\% (n=105) were Bell’s stage 1, and 19\% (n=25) were stage 2 or 3. Similar percent of control and NEC infants exceeded the 25th growth percentile for height (58\% vs. 63\%) and weight (64\% vs. 53\%). In multivariable analysis, history of NEC (OR 5.42 [2.10, 13.98]) was significantly associated with presence of long-term medical GI-Dx. Higher morbidity in NICU was associated with long-term surgical GI-Dx. Conclusion: Neonates diagnosed with NEC exhibit increased medical gastrointestinal morbidity in long- term follow-up. Growth outcomes are comparable between NICU graduates with and without NEC. Data analysis for this study is ongoing to include babies born 1989-2007 (\textasciitilde 650 additional patients) to improve power and further investigate outcomes over an even longer term.},

  abstract = {Introduction: About one-half of sudden cardiac deaths occur in those without known CAD suggesting the need for better risk-stratification tests. Autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV), can occur with myocardial ischemia. Testing for low HRV may help to identify high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. The association of low HRV with ischemia may also be greatest during the morning hours, when cardiac events (MI, sudden death) are most likely to be triggered. Hypothesis: In a cohort of veteran males with no known CAD, subclinical myocardial ischemia is associated with autonomic dysfunction as measured by low HRV; this association is greatest during morning hours. Methods: We evaluated 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in middle-aged twins without known CAD from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and calculated frequency domain and non-linear (Dyx) HRV metrics. All subjects underwent [13N]-ammonia positron emission tomography with adenosine stress, with ischemia defined as greater than 5\% perfusion deficit. Mixed models were used to compare HRV between ischemic and non-ischemic subjects in 1-hour intervals, and morning hours were 6 AM until 10 AM. Results: Data on 276 twin subjects were analyzed; the mean age (SD) was 53 (3) and 55 (20\%) had ischemia. HRV was significantly different between ischemic and non-ischemic twins during morning hours (figure 1), with the largest magnitude difference occurring with Dyx at 7 AM. Each SD decrease in Dyx associated with an OR for ischemia of 4.8 (95\% CI, 1.5 — 15.8). Dyx in morning hours remained significant in a subgroup of pairs discordant for ischemia and after risk factor adjustment. Significant differences by ischemia status were noted for low-frequency and very-low-frequency HRV. Conclusions: Lower HRV is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial ischemia primarily during morning hours. More research regarding this circadian autonomic vulnerability and its clinical implications are warranted. Download figure},

  abstract = {Background Abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system may occur in ischemic heart disease, but the mechanisms by which they are linked are not fully defined. The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion ({$>$}5\% affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. Results The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20\%) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7\,AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95\% CI, 1.5 — 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx\,{$<$}\,2.0, the 7\,AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95\% CI, 1.2 — 111.4). Conclusions Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.},

Understanding such mechanisms may help formulate prevention strategies. We therefore sought to evaluate potential physiologic effects of psychosocial factors by studying their associations with heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Hypothesis: Higher psychosocial stress levels are associated with lower HRV cross-sectionally in a diverse community sample. Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis. Psychosocial factors were assessed using validated instruments, including: 1) vital exhaustion, a somatic manifestation of chronic stress and depression, 2) anger proneness, a personality trait, and 3) perceived social support, a potential buffering factor for stress. Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 5.7 years, 55\% women, and 25\% black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3\% (95\% CI, 3.9\% - 21.3\%) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7\% (95\% CI, 3.1\% to 4.2\%) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not. The inverse vital exhaustion-HRV association raises concern regarding the somatic manifestations of stress, a potential target for preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may be important in both depression and coronary artery disease (CAD). A novel heart rate variability (HRV) metric, Dyx , may be a be a potentially useful tool to study ANS dysfunction in these diseases. We propose that ANS dysfunction, measured by decreased Dyx , will associate with both depression and obstructive CAD. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We included participants undergoing coronary angiography for suspected CAD. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). HRV data were collected continuously on participants before catheterization using a new ECG patch (VivaLNK). We assessed HRV by Dyx (primary) and high and low frequency power, multiscale entropy, and deceleration capacity. Two-sample t-tests and logistic regressions (with adjustment for age and sex) were used to study the difference in HRV (before cardiac catheterization) between those with high versus low depressive burden (PHQ-9 ≥ 10), and in those with versus without obstructive CAD ({$>$}70\% stenosis). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We assessed 30 individuals with mean (SD) age 62.4 (13.2); 7.1\% were female and 15.4\% were black. Mean Dyx in high depressive symptoms (N = 21, 70\%) was 1.8 (0.2) and in none-low depressive symptoms (N = 7, 23\%) was 2.2 (0.2). Differences were also observed for high frequency (HF) (4.4 (1.1) vs. 6.0 (1.4)) and deceleration capacity (−4.2 (2.1) vs. −10.7 (8.5)). Mean Dyx in obstructive CAD (N = 17, 57\%) and non-obstructive CAD (N = 10, 33\%) was 1.7 (0.6) and 2.6 (1.2) respectively. Differences were seen with sample entropy (1.2 (0.2) vs. 1.5 (0.2)). Every 1 unit of log(HF) had an odds ratio = 0.14 (95\% CI 0.06 – 0.36) for depression. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: ANS dysfunction, measured by HRV, associates with both depression and obstructive CAD. Autonomic ECG markers may play an important role in assessing brain-heart pathology, and may be useful to study the interaction between depression and CAD.},

  abstract = {Stress, both physiological and psychological, serve as triggers for cardiovascular events in those with a damaged cardiac substrate, such as ischemic heart disease. The physiological reaction to stress is mediated through the autonomic nervous system, which can be quantified through heart rate variability (HRV). We measured HRV in three cohorts that had varying burdens of ischemic heart disease, from no known disease, high risk of disease, and known disease after myocardial infarction. Each cohort also had varying types of HRV, from short-term recordings during acute psychological and physiological stress, to longer, diurnal recordings. Two of these cohorts were followed longitudinally to assess for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Short-term and cosinor HRV metrics served as the exposure and psychological stress, myocardial ischemia, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) served as outcomes in logistic regression modeling and survival analysis. Autonomic dysfunction was robustly associated with psychological stress, myocardial ischemia, and MACE. We found a significant relationship between circadian autonomic variability and depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. We found that autonomic dysfunction was also strongly related to mental stress- induced myocardial ischemia. We found that autonomic dysfunction, both to circadian changes and acute mental stress, was associated with an increased, independent risk for MACE. This suggests that autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV, plays an important, independent role in the additional cardiovascular risk seen in patients with psychological disease. This association highlights neurocardiac mechanisms as a not yet understood pathological process in both psychiatric and cardiovascular disease that may have implications in diagnosis and therapy.},

  abstract = {Background Genetic and familial contributions to early‐onset atrial fibrillation are described primarily in individuals of European ancestry. However, the role of racial and familial contributions in the pathogenesis of early‐onset atrial flutter (EOAFL) is unclear. Methods and Results In this cross‐sectional study, participants were enrolled prospectively from 2015 to 2021 in multiple academic centers with a diagnosis of atrial flutter (AFL) confirmed by ECG. EOAFL was defined as a diagnosis of AFL before age 66\,years with no concomitant or previous diagnosis of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Family history was adjudicated through baseline questionnaires and direct family interviews about the diagnosis of atrial tachyarrhythmias, stroke, and cardiomyopathy. The primary exposure was a positive family history in first‐degree relatives, and the primary outcome was the odds of EOAFL versus late‐onset AFL. A total of 909 patients were enrolled. Participants with a positive family history of atrial tachyarrhythmias were younger, less likely to be of Black race, and more likely to have EOAFL. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for EOAFL in those with a positive family history was 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.1–3.0). There was an increased odds of EOAFL in those of Black race (OR, 2.1 [95\% CI, 1.4–3.2]), alcohol use (OR, 1.6 [95\% CI, 1.0–2.6]), and obstructive sleep apnea (OR, 1.9 [95\% CI, 1.0–3.4]). Use of cardioselective β blockers or calcium channel blockers before the diagnosis of AFL were associated with a lower odds of EOAFL (OR, 0.5 [95\% CI, 0.2–0.9]). Conclusions These findings suggest a potentially hereditary predisposition to EOAFL across race and ethnicity, warranting further study of the genetic contributions to AFL.},

  abstract = {Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is a recognized phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its clinical significance in the contemporary clinical era has not been investigated.To compare the association of mental stress–induced or conventional stress–induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD.Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020).Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography.The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure.Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34\% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16\%) had mental stress–induced ischemia, 281 (31\%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10\%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress–induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress–induced ischemia was 2.5 (95\% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress–induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95\% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress–induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.5-2.5).Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress–induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress–induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress–induced ischemia has clinical value.},
